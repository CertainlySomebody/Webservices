    "shipDescription": "After the resounding success tied to the launch of the Drake-class Battlecruiser, the Caldari Navy signed up a massive order to acquire a specific version for its own arsenals. The outcome, the Drake Navy Issue, while sharing a similar look with its step-father, serves a completely different purpose on the battlefield. Being more mobile, able to project missiles more effectively at range, against smaller targets and on a wider selection of damage types, this ship is ideal to support small scale conflicts and raids.",
